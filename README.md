  ## Description
  This project helps developers quickly create a professional README for a new project without having to create the markdown syntax on their own.

  Typically a README for a project is an afterthought. This application takes the hassle of creating the markdown syntax for a README and makes the process quick and easy. All the developer has to do is enter their answers to the promts in their command line and a README file is created for them. 

  Here is a link to the use of this application "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aygVl-Lo7Ow3m-KCUR57Any6D2dtXkTT/view"

  ## What I Learned
  I learned how to import files, how to use node.js, improved my skills using the terminal command line, let and const variable declaration, arrow functions, and object deconstruction.

  ## Installation
  To install this application go to the link to the repository below. From there click the green code button and click the "Download ZIP" option in the dropdown menu. From there you can copy those files into a directory of your choice in your terminal. Open the file in whatever editor you like to use and then open the terminal in that editor to make sure you"re in the correct directory. Now you are able to run the application.

  ## Contributing
  Contributions are not accepted at the moment

  ## Tests
  Open the file in your preferred code editor and open the terminal command line, make sure you're in the root folder directory for the application, and type "node index.js" in the terminal command line. Now all you'll need to do is answer the questions. At the end of the questions you'll be presented with a "File successfully created!" message and you will see the "generated-README.md" file pop up in the list of files for your working folder.
